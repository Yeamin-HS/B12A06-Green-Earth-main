#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-

### 1) What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
- **var**: It is a Function-scoped, hoisted (initialized as `undefined`), allows re-declaration; can leak outside blocksâ€”avoid in modern code.
- **let**: Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized (TDZ), no re-declaration in the same scope; use for variables that will be reassigned.
- **const**: Block-scoped like `let` but cannot be reassigned. For objects/arrays, the binding is constant but internal values can change.

### 2) What is the difference between `map()`, `forEach()`, and `filter()`?
- **forEach**: Iterates and runs a callback for each element and does not return a new array (returns `undefined`).
- **map**: map convert each element and returns a new array of the same length.
- **filter**: It Returns a new array containing only the elements for which the callback returned `true`.

### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
 the arrow function do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` and are not suitable as constructors. its basically used  for callbacks and keeping the outer `this` type of keywords.

### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Destructuring meansb pulls values out from arrays or objects into variables :
```js
const [first, second] = [10, 20];
const { name, price: cost } = { name: "Mango Tree", price: 500 };
